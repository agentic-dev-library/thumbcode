# ThumbCode

**Code with your thumbs.** ThumbCode is a decentralized multi-agent mobile development platform that enables anyone to ship mobile apps by directing AI agents from their phone.

## What is ThumbCode?

ThumbCode puts the power of a development team in your pocket. Instead of writing code line by line, you direct a team of specialized AI agents — Architect, Implementer, Reviewer, and Tester — who work together to build, test, and deploy your apps.

## Philosophy

ThumbCode is built on three core principles:

### 1. Mobile-Native, Not Mobile-Adapted

Traditional IDEs were designed for keyboards and large screens. ThumbCode was built from scratch for touch interfaces and mobile constraints. Every interaction is optimized for thumbs.

### 2. Credential Sovereignty

Your API keys never leave your device. We use hardware-backed secure storage (Expo SecureStore) to ensure your credentials are encrypted and protected. There's no server to hack, no database to breach.

### 3. Agent-Driven Development

Instead of writing every line of code yourself, you direct AI agents who collaborate to build your vision. The human-in-the-loop approves key actions while agents handle the implementation details.

## Technology Stack

ThumbCode is built with modern, well-tested technologies:

- **React Native + Expo**: Cross-platform mobile with excellent TypeScript support
- **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS for React Native
- **isomorphic-git**: Client-side Git operations
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Claude & GPT**: Multi-model AI agent capabilities
