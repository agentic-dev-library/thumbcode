# Vision

**ThumbCode's mission is to democratize software development by putting the power of a development team in everyone's pocket.**

## The Problem

Software development has traditionally required:
- Expensive laptops or desktops
- Complex development environments
- Years of learning programming languages
- Access to collaboration tools and infrastructure

This creates barriers that exclude billions of people from participating in the creation of software.

## Our Solution

ThumbCode breaks down these barriers by:

1. **Mobile-First Development** — Your phone is your development environment
2. **AI Agent Teams** — Specialized agents handle the technical complexity
3. **Natural Language Interface** — Describe what you want, agents build it
4. **Credential Sovereignty** — You control your own API keys and data

## Where We're Going

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Core git operations on mobile
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Secure credential management
- GitHub integration

### Phase 2: Expansion

- Additional git providers (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Team collaboration features
- Offline-first architecture

### Phase 3: Ecosystem

- Plugin marketplace
- Custom agent creation
- Enterprise features
- Advanced project analytics

## Principles

### User Sovereignty

Your data, your keys, your code. ThumbCode never has access to your credentials or source code. Everything happens on your device.

### Agent Collaboration

Agents aren't just tools — they're team members. They communicate, coordinate, and collaborate to build software the way a human team would.

### Mobile-Native

We don't adapt desktop experiences to mobile. We design for mobile first, taking advantage of mobile-specific interactions and constraints.

### Open Development

ThumbCode is open source. Our development process is transparent, and we welcome community contributions.
