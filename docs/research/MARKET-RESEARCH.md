# Market Research (1.0)

This document captures ThumbCode’s market framing for 1.0 and consolidates the research references already present in the repo’s memory bank.

---

## Summary

ThumbCode is a **mobile-first agentic development environment**. The core differentiation is not “AI coding” broadly — it’s **orchestration + mobile-native workflows + BYOK** (no server dependency for credentials).

---

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors mentioned:
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Cursor (agentic IDE)
- Windsurf (agentic IDE)
- CLI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)

**Repo insight**: *no major competitor is mobile-first* — ThumbCode’s wedge is mobile-native orchestration.

---

## Market Forces (from repo research log)

Key market trends:
1. **Quality > Speed**: governance and reliability matter
2. **Multi-platform integration**: IDE + terminal + web
3. **Agent mode**: multi-step autonomous workflows
4. **Security concerns**: vulnerability risk in AI-generated code
5. **Mobile “vibe coding”**: emerging user behavior pattern

---

## Positioning for 1.0

### Who it’s for
- Mobile-native developers and makers
- Busy technical leaders who need to review/approve/push without a laptop
- Aspiring developers intimidated by desktop IDE complexity

### What we promise
- Full git workflow from the phone
- Multi-agent orchestration (Architect/Implementer/Reviewer/Tester)
- BYOK credential sovereignty (keys never leave device)
- Warm technical brand experience (organic design language)

---

## Next Research Steps (required for 1.0 completion)

To fully satisfy 1.0 “no deferrals,” we must produce:
- A structured competitor matrix (features, pricing model, credential handling)
- Messaging tests (tagline and value props)
- A validated onboarding funnel hypothesis (what makes users activate)

These outputs should be based on real sessions and documented alongside the usability framework (`docs/research/USABILITY-TESTING-FRAMEWORK.md`).
